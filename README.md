# Image Steganography

## Overview
Image Steganography is a lightweight yet powerful tool built with Python and Tkinter, enabling users to seamlessly embed (encode) and retrieve (decode) hidden messages within images. Leveraging Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding, it ensures secure and efficient message concealment without compromising image quality.

## Features
- **Load Image**: Upload an image to hide a message.
- **Secret Message Encoding**: Embed a hidden message into the image.

- **Secret Message Decoding**: Extract the hidden message from the modified image.

- **Save Modified Image**: Save the encoded image for later retrieval.

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built using Tkinter for easy interaction.
